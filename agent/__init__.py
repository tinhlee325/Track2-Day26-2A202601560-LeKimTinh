"""agent — YOUR Task 3 build (FINAL-PLAN.md section 5.1: "the student's
biggest build"). Five files, each scored differently — read agent/README.md
first, it maps all five to what each decides and which of the 17 rubric
classes (CONTRACTS.md section 6.1) each one can save you from.

    gateway.py      the control plane: Gateway.decide(cmd) -> Decision
                     (CONTRACTS.md section 4, exactly)
    strategy.py      integrated discovery / delegation / cache / replica /
                     adaptive budget policy
    guardrails.py    grounding, injection, redaction, numeric precision,
                     and multi-signal abstention
    telemetry.py     ctx.emit wrappers — your own side only, never scored
    prompt.md        the system prompt LAYERED ON TOP of kit.loop.prompt's
                     harness prompt (not a replacement for it)

Public surface, re-exported for convenience — everything below is YOUR OWN
code (RULES.md section 1: "you own, entirely: agent/"), written together in
one pass, so — unlike `kit/`'s subpackages, which degrade import-by-import
because several are written by other people concurrently (workspace hard
rule 2) — these four imports are expected to always succeed together:

    from agent import Command, Decision, GatewayContext, Gateway
    from agent import BudgetPacer, ResultCache, should_delegate
    from agent import GroundingResult, check_grounding, abstention_policy
    from agent import Telemetry, RecordingGatewayContext
